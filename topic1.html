        In its early stages, the web was simply a way to share information digitally. Tim Berners-Lee was one of the biggest contributors to 
        what we know as the World Wide Web today, through his development of HTML, URI/URL, and HTTP. Through these technologies, there was a 
        foundation for structuring, accessing, and processing data via the web. While URI/URL’s and HTTP are core necessities for the use of 
        the web, HTML created a universal and intuitive way for anybody to create something accessible on the web. This markup language is 
        the outline for how websites are created so they can properly be read and displayed by your web browser. Without the need for special 
        application knowledge, or deep understanding of different systems and protocols, HTML opened the door for many people to dip their 
        feet into the ocean of the World Wide Web. 
        <br>
        In 1994, Tim Berners-Lee founded the World Wide Web Consortium to develop open web standards, which further created concepts 
        that are the backbone of today’s web. Some of these include decentralization which prevents censorship and surveillance, and 
        non-discrimination through equity, aka. Net Neutrality. 
        <br>
        A later advancement was the introduction of advanced processing power with programming capabilities at server side, client side, or 
        both. This being called the “Dynamic Web” allowed for much more functional applications such as sites for shopping, web-tools, 
        and even games. This unlocked many features for sites that are now taken as standard, such as built in forums, instant messaging, 
        and more.
