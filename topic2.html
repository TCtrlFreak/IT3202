        While the early web and dynamic web were great and accessible on many platforms, they were more of an application, which led to the 
        next leap: “Web as a Platform”. Becoming an underlying platform where applications were developed based on web technologies and 
        standards rather than the operating system, allowed for even larger outreach for applications and simplicity for development. Not 
        only did this continue to promote helpful standards and practices, but it also continued to make information and applications 
        quicker, easier, and compatibly move across the globe. One of the biggest challenges as a developer is making something compatible 
        on a large range of platforms and operating systems, but this was greatly simplified with the advancement to “Web as a Platform”.
        <br>
        The next biggest leap in the World Wide Web is to where we are today. Moving on to the “Modern Mobile Web” we see the rising 
        popularity of smartphones, tablets, and other mobile devices. With this came different sized and touch capable screens, and so 
        the push for newly designed web applications. On top of new design, underlying architecture and interactions had to change to 
        accommodate users and their devices. Now many developers must consider how their web applications will function, perform, and 
        look on multiple platform formats. While this seems like a step back to pre- “Web as a Platform”, with modern tools, it’s an 
        introduction to a larger audience when utilized properly.
        <br>
        The development of the World Wide Web is one of the biggest leaps in information and social interactions between people and has 
        unlocked many doors to advancing our society. Without the work from Tim Bernes-Lee, the major advancements over time, and the 
        integration of mobile devices into many people’s lives, our world would be vastly different.
